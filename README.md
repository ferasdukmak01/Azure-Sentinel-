    <h1>SIEM Lab</h1>
    <p> Summary:
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management System. It is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations. It is a tool that collects event log data from a range of sources within a network such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Identity solutions, etc. This allows the security professionals to monitor, prioritize and remediate potential threats in real-time. A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap in a controlled and safe environment to lure attackers. An intentionally compromised computer system to study how attackers work, examine different types of threats and improve security policies. This lab's purpose is to understand how to collect honeypot attack log data, query it in a SIEM and display it in a manner that is easy to understand such data. In this case it will be displayed in a world map by event count and geolocation.

Step 8: Scripting the Security Log Exporter
In VM open Powershell ISE
Set up Edge without signing in
Copy Powershell script into VM's Powershell 
Select New Script in Powershell ISE and paste script
Save to Desktop and give it a name (Log_Exporter)


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K6vzWAz.png" alt="Lab Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Make an account with Free IP Geolocation API and Accurate IP Lookup Database
This account is free for 1000 API calls per day. Paying 15.00$ will allow 150,000 API calls per month.

Copy API key once logged in and paste into script line 2: $API_KEY = "<API key>"
Hit Save
Run the PowerShell ISE script (Green play button) in the virtual machine to continuously produce log data

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LSQTeCy.png" alt="Lab Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

The script will export data from the Windows Event Viewer to then import into the IP Geolocation service. It will then extract the latitude and longitude and then create a new log called failed_rdp.log in the following location: C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log

Step 9: Create Custom Log in Log Analytics Workspace
Create a custom log to import the additional data from the IP Geolocation service into Azure Sentinel
Search "Run" in VM and type "C:\ProgramData"
Open file named "failed_rdp" hit CTRL + A to select all and CTRL + C to copy selection
Open notepad on Host PC and paste contents
Save to desktop as "failed_rdp.log"
In Azure go to Log Analytics Workspaces > Log Analytics workspace name (honeypot-log) > Custom logs > Add custom log
Sample
Select Sample log saved to Desktop (failed_rdp.log) and hit Next
Record delimiter
Review sample logs in Record delimiter and hit Next
Collection paths
Type > Windows
Path > "C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log"
Details
Give the custom log a name and provide description (FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO) and hit Next
Hit Create

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ibnkFk.png" alt="Lab Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Step 10: Query the Custom Log
In Log Analytics Workspaces go to the created workspace (honeypot-log) > Logs
Run a query to see the available data (FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL)
May take some time for Azure to sync VM and Log Analytics

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EeBNLhx.png" alt="Lab Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Step 11: Extract Fields from Custom Log
The RawData within a log contains information such as latitude, longitude, destinationhost, etc. Data will have to be extracted to create separate fields for the different types of data

Right click any of the log results
Select Extract fields from 'FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL'
Highlight ONLY the value after the ":"
Name the Field Title the name of the field of the value
Under Field Type select the appropriate data type
Hit Extract
If the search results data looks good click the Save extraction button
Do this for ALL available fields in RawData
NOTE: If one of the search results is not correct select Modify this highlight (upper right corner of result) and highlight the correct value. Otherwise go to Custom logs > Custom fields Accept warning of unsaved edits and delete field. Redo extraction for deleted field.
